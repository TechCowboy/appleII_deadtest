### Adrian's wishlist

- After ZP/stack test, when printing the welcome banner with RAM size, could we print all 255 characters on screen as well?

  - This will let people know if their character generator supports lower-case or not.

#### Done:

- Longer pause after all RAM good. 5 seconds?

- Beep out bank error and bit error, in case screen isn't working

#### No longer applicable:

- Welcome screen should print may want to add the message:

        BANK ERROR REPORTS ACCURATE FOR APPLE ][ AND ][+
